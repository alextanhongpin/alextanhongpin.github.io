  <p>You are looking at it now! ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
  <p>Why my first website is also my favorite - because it is simple.</p>

  <p>It was Jun 2014 that I decided to create my personal website.</p>
  <p>
    With my limited knowledge in HTML and CSS, I designed my website with as
    little code as possible. That aligns with the principle
    <a
      href="https://wiki.c2.com/?MakeItWorkMakeItRightMakeItFast"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer">
      make it work, make it right, make it fast
    </a>
    . ðŸ˜Š
  </p>

  <h4>Technology Stack</h4>

  <p>
    I have rewritten the site a few times over the years, mainly to keep up to
    date with new technologies. But simplicity is still at its core.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Past</b>- from vanilla JavaScript to jQuery to Backbone.js to hyperapp
      with plain CSS3
    </li>
    <li><b>Present</b>- Svelte, now with CSS Variables and CSS Grid layout</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Keeping things simple is hard, especially when you are equipped with more
    knowledge. When I look back at the old code that I wrote years ago, I tend
    to ponder -<i>was I the one who wrote this?</i>
    Then I will look at my current code and rewrite it to be simpler. Somehow I
    just need to remind myself not to complicate things
    <i>just because you can</i>.
  </p>

  <h4>Design Principles</h4>

  <p>
    I have learn and adopted several design principles when designing this site.
    This includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>limiting color choices to just red, white and shades of black</li>
    <li>structuring components using <b>Atomic Design Pattern</b></li>
    <li>
      using
      <b>Block Elements Modifier (BEM)</b>
      naming methodology (before CSS are scoped, this is the convention I used
      to avoid clashing class names)
    </li>
    <li>
      mixing two different fonts a.k.a
      <i>font pairing</i>
      to make the title stands out from the content
    </li>
    <li>
      applying
      <b>Modular Scale</b>
      (perfect fourth: 4 / 3) and
      <b>Vertical Rhythm</b>
      to improve readability of the site
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I think applying patterns, and being aware of the philosophy behind each
    decision makes a difference in the end result. See the difference in one of
    the page below by clicking on it.

  <p>It keeps getting better and better. ðŸ˜„</p>
