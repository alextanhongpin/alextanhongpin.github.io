          <h3>My Personal Website</h3>
          <p>19 May 2020</p>
        </div>

        <p>It was Jun 2014 that I decided to create my personal website.</p>
        <p>
          With my limited knowledge in HTML and CSS, I designed my website with
          as little code as possible. That aligns with the principle
          <a
            href="https://wiki.c2.com/?MakeItWorkMakeItRightMakeItFast"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">
            make it work, make it right, make it fast
          </a>
          . ðŸ˜Š
        </p>

        <h4>Technology Stack</h4>

        <p>
          I have rewritten the site a few times over the years, mainly to keep
          up to date with new technologies. But simplicity is still at its core.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Past</b>
            - from vanilla JavaScript to jQuery to Backbone.js to hyperapp with
            plain CSS3
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Present</b>
            - Svelte, now with CSS Variables and CSS Grid layout
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Keeping things simple is hard, especially when you are equipped with
          more knowledge. When I look back at the old code that I wrote years
          ago, I tend to ponder -
          <i>was I the one who wrote this?</i>
          Then I will look at my current code and rewrite it to be simpler.
          Somehow I just need to remind myself not to complicate things
          <i>just because you can</i>
          .
        </p>

        <h4>Design Principles</h4>

        <p>
          I have learn and adopted several design principles when designing this
          site. This includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>limiting color choices to just red, white and shades of black</li>
          <li>structuring components using <b>Atomic Design Pattern</b></li>
          <li>
            using
            <b>Block Elements Modifier (BEM)</b>
            naming methodology (before CSS are scoped, this is the convention I
            used to avoid clashing class names)
          </li>
          <li>
            mixing two different fonts a.k.a
            <i>font pairing</i>
            to make the title stands out from the content
          </li>
          <li>
            applying
            <b>Modular Scale</b>
            (perfect fourth: 4 / 3) and
            <b>Vertical Rhythm</b>
            to improve readability of the site
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I think applying patterns, and being aware of the philosophy behind
          each decision makes a difference in the end result. See the difference
          in one of the page below by clicking on it.
        </p>
        <p>Before:</p>
        <a
          href="/assets/img/project/old-website.png"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">
          <img
            src="/assets/img/project/old-website.png"
            width="100%"
            height="auto" />
        </a>
        <p>After:</p>

        <a
          href="/assets/img/project/new-website.png"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">
          <img
            src="/assets/img/project/new-website.png"
            width="100%"
            height="auto" />
        </a>

        <p>It keeps getting better and better. ðŸ˜„</p>
