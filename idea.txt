SO I have basically learnt all the basics of HTML5, CSS3, WebGL etc.
Time to make this to use.

Problem:
1.No Preloader for websites. Image load simultaneously.
	-make Image load from top to bottom. 
	-add preloader for each images?
	-use jQuery to load images?
	-use CSS3 3D to style images
	-canvas Animation vs CSS Keyframes!
	-$(document).ready() starts when the document is preparing
	-$(windows).load() problem is that it waits for the window to load completely first. Maybe I can use this together with keyframes.

var parent = document.getElementById("div1");
var child = document.getElementById("p1");
parent.removeChild(child);


2.Grid Style

3. No uummphh!!! Be creative! Let the creativity flows in you like a river! You can feel it.
